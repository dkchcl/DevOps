## üéôÔ∏è Audio-Style Practice Script (Baat karne jaisa bolne ka tarika)

Bolne ke waqt aise confidently bol:

---

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Raw Materials Monitoring**

"We use sensors to track sugar, CO‚ÇÇ, and flavors. When stock goes low, an automatic order is sent to the supplier."

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Machine Monitoring**

"We monitor machine health in real-time ‚Äì like temperature and speed. If anything goes wrong, an alert goes to the engineer, and logs are saved automatically."

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Staff Task Automation**

"Employee tasks are auto-assigned daily. Attendance is tracked using biometrics, and reports are generated in Power BI."

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ **Factory Software Setup Automation**

"We use automation to deploy factory tools like websites or log systems. This helps in quickly setting up new factory branches."

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ **Delivery & Vehicle Tracking**

"We track delivery vehicles using GPS, send automatic updates, and generate fuel and delay reports."

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ **Electricity & Water Monitoring**

"We monitor electricity and water usage. If usage crosses the limit, an alert is triggered. Daily usage reports are created."

### 7Ô∏è‚É£ **Cost & Money Monitoring**

"We track where money is spent. If costs suddenly rise, we get alerts. Monthly financial reports are generated automatically."

### 8Ô∏è‚É£ **License & Legal Automation**

"We get reminders for license renewals, store documents in the cloud, and use a dashboard to check legal status."

---

### üîö Final Line (Most important):

"I helped automate different parts of the factory like raw materials, machines, staff, delivery, utilities, and cost tracking. We used Azure tools like IoT Hub, Logic Apps, Power BI, and DevOps for real-time data, alerts, and automatic reports. This reduced manual work and improved efficiency."
