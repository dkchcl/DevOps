You're setting up a **self-hosted Azure DevOps agent** on your machine. Here's a step-by-step explanation of what this script and process does:

---

### üîß **Step-by-Step Breakdown**

---

### 1. **Open PowerShell as Administrator**

You must have elevated privileges to install the agent as a Windows service.

---

### 2. **Navigate to the Agent Folder**

```powershell
cd C:\Users\DKC\Desktop\Agent
```

This changes the current directory to where the Azure DevOps agent setup files are located.

---

### 3. **Run the Configuration Script**

```powershell
.\config.cmd
```

This launches the interactive configuration process for the Azure DevOps agent.

---

### 4. **You‚Äôre Prompted with Several Setup Questions**

#### ‚úÖ **Connect to Azure DevOps**

```text
Enter server URL > https://dev.azure.com/DkcOpsTech
```

You're telling the agent where your Azure DevOps organization lives.

---

#### üîê **Authentication**

```text
Enter authentication type (press enter for PAT) >
Enter personal access token > ********
```

You‚Äôre using a **Personal Access Token (PAT)** to authenticate.

---

#### üîó **Register Agent**

```text
Enter agent pool (press enter for default) > frontend
```

* You‚Äôre assigning this agent to the **`frontend` pool**, a group of agents.

```text
Enter agent name (press enter for DESKTOP-UST2ML9) >
```

* You can name the agent or keep the default (your computer‚Äôs hostname).

---

### üß∞ **Tool Scanning**

* The agent scans installed tools (e.g., Node.js, .NET SDK) to report capabilities.

---

### üìÇ **Work Folder**

```text
Enter work folder (press enter for _work) >
```

* This is where the agent will store build and pipeline files.

---

### üõ†Ô∏è **Install Agent as a Windows Service**

```text
Enter run agent as service? (Y/N) > y
```

This lets the agent run continuously in the background as a **Windows service**.

---

### üîì **SID Type Unrestricted**

```text
Enter enable SERVICE_SID_TYPE_UNRESTRICTED > y
```

This enables advanced permission handling for the service.

---

### üë§ **Service Account**

```text
Enter User account for the service (press enter for NT AUTHORITY\NETWORK SERVICE) >
```

* You're choosing the default local system account to run the service.

---

### üßæ **Service Installation Summary**

Several messages confirm the service has been:

* Installed
* Configured
* Set to **delayed auto-start** (starts after boot-up delays)
* Given the correct **permissions**

---

### ‚õî **Prevent Immediate Start**

```text
Enter whether to prevent service starting immediately after configuration > y
```

You‚Äôre deferring the automatic start of the agent service (you‚Äôll start it manually).

---

### üìÇ **Unblock Script**

```powershell
Unblock-File .\run.cmd
```

* Ensures Windows allows the `.cmd` file to be executed (important if it was downloaded).

---

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è **Run the Agent**

```powershell
.\run.cmd
```

* Manually starts the agent to register it with Azure DevOps and begin processing jobs.

---

## ‚úÖ **Summary**

You‚Äôve **successfully configured a self-hosted Azure DevOps build agent** on your Windows machine to:

* Connect to your Azure DevOps organization
* Join a specific agent pool (`frontend`)
* Run as a Windows service (under `NT AUTHORITY\NETWORK SERVICE`)
* Start manually (not automatically right after install)

---

Would you like help starting the service now or testing if the agent is working properly?
