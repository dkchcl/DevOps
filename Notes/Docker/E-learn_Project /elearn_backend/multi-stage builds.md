**multi-stage builds**

- Here's a brief description and comments for each part of the Dockerfile:

```dockerfile
# Use the official .NET SDK image as the base image for building the application
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk:8.0 AS build-base

# Set the working directory inside the container to /dkc23
WORKDIR /dkc23

# Copy the application code from the local machine into the container
COPY . .

# Restore the .NET project dependencies (e.g., NuGet packages)
RUN dotnet restore

# Build the .NET project in Release configuration (for optimization)
RUN dotnet build --configuration Release

# Publish the .NET project (prepare it for production deployment)
RUN dotnet publish -c Release -o .

# Use the official .NET ASP.NET image as the base image for the runtime environment
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspnet:8.0

# Set the working directory inside the container to /dkc90
WORKDIR /dkc90

# Copy the published application from the build container (build-base) into the new container
COPY --from=build-base /dkc23 .

# Set the entry point for the container to run the application (ElearnBackend.dll)
ENTRYPOINT ["dotnet", "ElearnBackend.dll"]
```

### Dockerfile Breakdown:

This Dockerfile uses **multi-stage builds** to create a more efficient Docker image for a .NET application. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

---

### **1. Build Stage:****(First Stage)**
- **Base Image:**  
  ```dockerfile
  FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk:8.0 AS build-base
  ```
  - **Purpose:** This stage uses the **.NET SDK** image, which includes all the necessary tools to build and publish a .NET application.
  - It's named `build-base` to indicate it's the build stage of the process.

- **Set Working Directory:**
  ```dockerfile
  WORKDIR /dkc23
  ```
  - **Purpose:** Sets `/dkc23` as the directory where all the subsequent commands (like `COPY`, `RUN`, etc.) will be executed.

- **Copy Application Code:**
  ```dockerfile
  COPY . .
  ```
  - **Purpose:** This copies all the code from your local machine (where the Dockerfile is located) into the `/dkc23` directory inside the container.

- **Restore Dependencies:**
  ```dockerfile
  RUN dotnet restore
  ```
  - **Purpose:** Restores the NuGet packages and dependencies defined in the project file.

- **Build the Application:**
  ```dockerfile
  RUN dotnet build --configuration Release
  ```
  - **Purpose:** Builds the application in **Release** mode (optimized for production).

- **Publish the Application:**
  ```dockerfile
  RUN dotnet publish -c Release -o .
  ```
  - **Purpose:** Prepares the application for production by publishing it to a specific output folder (here, the current directory `/dkc23`).

---

### **2. Runtime Stage:****(Second Stage)**
- **Base Image:**  
  ```dockerfile
  FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspnet:8.0
  ```
  - **Purpose:** This stage uses the **.NET ASP.NET runtime** image, which is a lightweight image that only includes the necessary runtime components to run the application (no SDK or build tools).

- **Set Working Directory:**
  ```dockerfile
  WORKDIR /dkc90
  ```
  - **Purpose:** Sets `/dkc90` as the directory where the application will run in the final container.

- **Copy Published Code:**
  ```dockerfile
  COPY --from=build-base /dkc23 .
  ```
  - **Purpose:** This copies the application that was built and published in the first stage (`build-base`) into the `/dkc90` directory in the runtime container.

- **Set Entry Point:**
  ```dockerfile
  ENTRYPOINT ["dotnet", "ElearnBackend.dll"]
  ```
  - **Purpose:** Defines the command to run when the container starts, which in this case, is the **ElearnBackend.dll** (the compiled application). The `dotnet` command runs the application.

---

### **Summary of Multi-Stage Build Process:**
1. **Build Stage (build-base):**
   - The code is copied into a container, dependencies are restored, and the app is built and published in **Release** mode.
   
2. **Runtime Stage:**
   - The lightweight **ASP.NET runtime image** is used to create a smaller final image by copying the published application into it and setting the entry point to run the application.

---

### **Why Multi-Stage Builds?**
- **Smaller Final Image:** The final image only contains the runtime and the necessary application files (not the build tools), which reduces the image size significantly.
- **Separation of Concerns:** Separating the build and runtime environments makes it easier to manage and optimize both stages independently.
