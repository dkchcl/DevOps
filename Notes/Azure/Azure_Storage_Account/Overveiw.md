### Class Notes on Azure Storage Accounts

**Azure Storage Account Overview:**
Azure Storage Accounts are a core service in Microsoft Azure, providing highly available, scalable, and secure cloud storage for data in different types of formats. They are the foundation for services like Azure Blob Storage, File Storage, Queue Storage, Table Storage, and Disk Storage.

A **storage account** is a container that holds data and provides access to it through various types of storage services. Azure storage accounts enable the storage of large amounts of unstructured data (blobs) or structured data (tables), and also support file shares, queues, and virtual machine disks.

### Types of Storage Accounts
Azure provides several types of storage accounts based on the requirements for your data:

1. **General-purpose v2 (GPv2)**: Most commonly used account type that supports all the latest Azure storage features, including Blob Storage, File Storage, Table Storage, and Queue Storage.
2. **General-purpose v1 (GPv1)**: Older version, which supports fewer features than GPv2. It offers lower pricing for basic workloads but lacks some modern storage features.
3. **Blob Storage**: Optimized for storing large amounts of unstructured data, such as text and binary data.
4. **File Storage**: Provides cloud-based file shares that are accessible via SMB (Server Message Block) protocol.
5. **Block Blob Storage**: Primarily for storing files and other unstructured data.
6. **Queue Storage**: Useful for storing and managing messages that can be read asynchronously by different systems.
7. **Table Storage**: A NoSQL key-value store for structured data.
