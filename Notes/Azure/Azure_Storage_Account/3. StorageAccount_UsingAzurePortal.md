## Create Azure Storage Account & Containers--

### Azure Storage Account:

### 1. Using Azure Portal:

To create an **Azure Storage Account** using the **Azure Portal**, follow these steps:

#### Steps to Create an Azure Storage Account in the Azure Portal:

1. **Sign in to the Azure Portal**:
   - Open your browser and go to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com).
   - Sign in with your Microsoft account or Azure Active Directory credentials.

2. **Navigate to the "Storage accounts" section**:
   - In the left-hand menu, click on **"Create a resource"** (or use the search bar at the top to search for "Storage account").
   - In the "Create a resource" pane, click on **"Storage"**, then select **"Storage account"**.

3. **Configure the Storage Account**:
   On the **"Create storage account"** page, fill in the required fields:

   - **Subscription**: Select the Azure subscription that you want to use for the storage account.
   
   - **Resource group**:
     - Select an existing resource group or click **"Create new"** to create a new resource group.
   
   - **Storage account name**:
     - Choose a **unique** name for your storage account. It must be between 3 and 24 characters, and can only contain lowercase letters and numbers.
   
   - **Region**:
     - Select the Azure region where you want to create the storage account (e.g., East US, West Europe, etc.).
   
   - **Performance**:
     - Choose between **Standard** (for general-purpose storage) or **Premium** (for high-performance storage, typically used for workloads requiring low latency).
   
   - **Account kind**:
     - **StorageV2** (recommended): This is the most common choice and supports both blobs and other services like tables, queues, and files.
     - **BlobStorage**: Choose this for specialized blob storage.
     - **Storage (General Purpose v1)**: Older option with limited features.
     - **FileStorage**: For Azure file share use cases.

   - **Replication**:
     - Select the replication option (depends on your availability and durability needs):
       - **Locally redundant storage (LRS)**: Replicates your data within a single region.
       - **Geo-redundant storage (GRS)**: Replicates your data to a secondary region for disaster recovery.
       - **Zone-redundant storage (ZRS)**: Replicates your data across availability zones in a region.
   
   - **Access tier** (for Blob storage only):
     - Choose **Hot** for frequently accessed data or **Cool** for infrequently accessed data.

4. **Networking (optional)**:
   - In the **Networking** section, you can configure network access rules, such as whether to allow access from selected virtual networks, private endpoints, or all networks. You can skip this step for now if you don't have specific requirements.

5. **Security (optional)**:
   - You can configure additional security features like **Azure AD authentication**, **secure transfer required**, and **key management** options.
   - If you're unsure, you can keep the default settings for now.

6. **Review and Create**:
   - After configuring the settings, click **"Review + create"** at the bottom of the page.
   - The portal will display a summary of the settings you've chosen. If everything looks good, click **"Create"**.

#### Wait for the Storage Account to be Created:
- The Azure portal will start deploying the storage account. This usually takes a few minutes.
- Once the deployment is complete, you will see a notification that your storage account has been created successfully.

#### Access Your New Storage Account:
- After the storage account is created, you can navigate to it by going to the **"Storage accounts"** section in the portal.
- Select your new storage account to manage it, including creating and managing containers, file shares, tables, or queues.

That's it! You've successfully created an Azure Storage Account using the Azure Portal.
