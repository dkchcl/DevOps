## Create Azure Storage Account & Containers--

### Azure Storage Account:

### 1. Using Azure Portal:

To create an **Azure Storage Account** using the **Azure Portal**, follow these steps:

#### Steps to Create an Azure Storage Account in the Azure Portal:

1. **Sign in to the Azure Portal**:
   - Open your browser and go to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com).
   - Sign in with your Microsoft account or Azure Active Directory credentials.

2. **Navigate to the "Storage accounts" section**:
   - In the left-hand menu, click on **"Create a resource"** (or use the search bar at the top to search for "Storage account").
   - In the "Create a resource" pane, click on **"Storage"**, then select **"Storage account"**.

3. **Configure the Storage Account**:
   On the **"Create storage account"** page, fill in the required fields:

   - **Subscription**: Select the Azure subscription that you want to use for the storage account.
   
   - **Resource group**:
     - Select an existing resource group or click **"Create new"** to create a new resource group.
   
   - **Storage account name**:
     - Choose a **unique** name for your storage account. It must be between 3 and 24 characters, and can only contain lowercase letters and numbers.
   
   - **Region**:
     - Select the Azure region where you want to create the storage account (e.g., East US, West Europe, etc.).
   
   - **Performance**:
     - Choose between **Standard** (for general-purpose storage) or **Premium** (for high-performance storage, typically used for workloads requiring low latency).
   
   - **Account kind**:
     - **StorageV2** (recommended): This is the most common choice and supports both blobs and other services like tables, queues, and files.
     - **BlobStorage**: Choose this for specialized blob storage.
     - **Storage (General Purpose v1)**: Older option with limited features.
     - **FileStorage**: For Azure file share use cases.

   - **Replication**:
     - Select the replication option (depends on your availability and durability needs):
       - **Locally redundant storage (LRS)**: Replicates your data within a single region.
       - **Geo-redundant storage (GRS)**: Replicates your data to a secondary region for disaster recovery.
       - **Zone-redundant storage (ZRS)**: Replicates your data across availability zones in a region.
   
   - **Access tier** (for Blob storage only):
     - Choose **Hot** for frequently accessed data or **Cool** for infrequently accessed data.

4. **Networking (optional)**:
   - In the **Networking** section, you can configure network access rules, such as whether to allow access from selected virtual networks, private endpoints, or all networks. You can skip this step for now if you don't have specific requirements.

5. **Security (optional)**:
   - You can configure additional security features like **Azure AD authentication**, **secure transfer required**, and **key management** options.
   - If you're unsure, you can keep the default settings for now.

6. **Review and Create**:
   - After configuring the settings, click **"Review + create"** at the bottom of the page.
   - The portal will display a summary of the settings you've chosen. If everything looks good, click **"Create"**.

#### Wait for the Storage Account to be Created:
- The Azure portal will start deploying the storage account. This usually takes a few minutes.
- Once the deployment is complete, you will see a notification that your storage account has been created successfully.

#### Access Your New Storage Account:
- After the storage account is created, you can navigate to it by going to the **"Storage accounts"** section in the portal.
- Select your new storage account to manage it, including creating and managing containers, file shares, tables, or queues.

That's it! You've successfully created an Azure Storage Account using the Azure Portal. 


### 2. Using Azure CLI:

- Download & Run the Azure CLI. 

- Run the Azure CLI After installation, close and reopen any active terminal window. Run the Azure CLI with the az command from either Windows Command Prompt or PowerShell. 

**Step 1:** Connect to Your Azure Account You need to authenticate to your Azure account:
```powershell
az login 
```
**Step 2:** A common first step is to check your active subscription. 
```powershell
az account show
```
**Step 3:** Create a Resource Group (if needed) If you don't already have a resource group, you can create one:
```powershell
az group create -Name dineshapirgnew -Location EastUS 
```
**Step 4:** Create a Storage Account (if needed) If you don't already have a storage account, you can create one:
```powershell
az storage account create --name dineshstorage4321 --resource-group dineshapirgnew --location eastus --sku S
tandard_LRS
```
OR
```
az storage account create --name mystr230490 --resource-group tonubhai-RG --location centralindia --sku Standard_ZRS --encryption-services blob
```
**Result:**

Successfully created.

#### Create Azure Containers within Storage Account:

```
az storage container create --account-name mystr230490 --name mycontainer90 --auth-mode login
```
**Resut:**
```
{
  "created": true
}
```
#### Upload a blob:

Blob storage supports block blobs, append blobs, and page blobs. The examples in this quickstart show how to work with block blobs.

First, create a file to upload to a block blob. If you're using Azure Cloud Shell, use the following command to create a file:

```
az storage blob upload --account-name mystr230490 --container-name mycontainer90 --name myFile.txt --file Test123.txt --auth-mode login
```

### 3. Using Azure Powershell:

Creating a container in an Azure Storage Account using PowerShell is a straightforward process. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide to help you:

**Step 1:** Install Azure PowerShell Module If you haven't already installed the Azure PowerShell module, you can do so by running the following command:
```powershell
Install-Module -Name Az -AllowClobber -Force 
```
**Step 2:** Connect to Your Azure Account You need to authenticate to your Azure account:
```powershell
Connect-AzAccount 
```
**Step 3:** Create a Resource Group (if needed) If you don't already have a resource group, you can create one:
```powershell
New-AzResourceGroup -Name "myResourceGroup" -Location "EastUS" 
```
**Step 4:** Create a Storage Account (if needed) If you don't already have a storage account, you can create one:
```powershell
New-AzStorageAccount -ResourceGroupName "myResourceGroup" -Name "mystorageaccount" -Location "EastUS" -SkuName "Standard_LRS"
```
**Create Azure Containers within Storage Account --**

Create a Container Now, you can create a container within your storage account:

Get the storage account context
```powershell
$storageAccount = Get-AzStorageAccount -ResourceGroupName "myResourceGroup" -Name "mystorageaccount"
```
```powershell
$ctx = $storageAccount.Context
```
Create the container
```powershell
New-AzStorageContainer -Name "mycontainer" -Context $ctx
```

Feel free to adapt the resource group name, storage account name, and container name to suit your needs. If you encounter any issues, I'm here to help!
