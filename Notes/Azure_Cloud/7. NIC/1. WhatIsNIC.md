## **Azure NIC**

### ðŸ”· What is an Azure NIC?

**NIC stands for Network Interface Card.**

In Azure, a **NIC** is a **virtual device** that connects a **Virtual Machine (VM)** to a network.

Whenever you create a VM in Azure, it gets a **NIC attached** to it. Through this NIC, the VM can:

* Connect to the internet
* Communicate with other VMs
* Send and receive network traffic

---

### ðŸ”Œ What does a NIC do?

Think of a NIC like a **SIM card in your phone**. Just like your phone can't connect to any network without a SIM card, a VM can't connect to any network without a NIC.

### ðŸ”§ Important features of Azure NIC:

1. **IP Addresses:**

   * Gets a **private IP** for internal communication inside the Azure network
   * Optionally gets a **public IP** for communication over the internet

2. **Network Security Group (NSG):**

   * Acts like a firewall, controlling which traffic is allowed or blocked on the NIC

3. **Multiple NICs per VM:**

   * A VM can have more than one NIC for complex network setups

4. **Connected to a Virtual Network (VNet):**

   * The NIC connects the VM to an Azure VNet, which is like a private network for your resources

---

### ðŸ§  Simple Example:

Imagine you create a **web server VM** in Azure. You want it to:

* Receive requests from the internet
* Talk to a backend database VM privately

So, the VMâ€™s NIC will have:

* A **public IP** to connect with the internet (so users can access your website)
* A **private IP** to connect with the database VM securely

The NIC is the medium through which your VM handles this networking.
