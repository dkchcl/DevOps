### ðŸ”¹ **What is an Azure Public IP?**

A **Public IP Address** in Azure is an IP address that is **accessible from the internet**. It allows external devices (like your personal computer or users across the world) to connect to Azure resources.

If you set up something like a **Virtual Machine (VM)** in Azure and want to access it over the internet, youâ€™ll need to assign a **Public IP** to it.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Simple Example:

Imagine you create a **Virtual Machine (VM)** in Azure and you want to connect to it using **Remote Desktop (RDP)** from your home.

You canâ€™t do that unless your VM has a **Public IP Address**, which acts like the "door number" through which the internet finds and connects to your VM.
