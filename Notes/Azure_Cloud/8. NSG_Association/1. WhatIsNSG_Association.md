## **Azure NSG\_Association** 

---

### 🔐 What is an NSG (Network Security Group)?

An **NSG** is like a **firewall** in Azure.
It controls **inbound (incoming)** and **outbound (outgoing)** traffic to your resources in a **virtual network**.

An NSG contains **rules** that either **allow** or **deny** traffic based on:

* Source IP
* Destination IP
* Port number
* Protocol (TCP/UDP)

### 🔗 What is NSG\_Association?

**NSG\_Association** simply means **attaching or linking an NSG** to a resource.

You can associate (attach) an NSG to two types of resources:

1. **Subnet** — to control traffic for all resources inside that subnet.
2. **Network Interface (NIC)** — to control traffic for a specific VM.

When you link (associate) an NSG to either a **subnet** or a **NIC**, that’s called **NSG\_Association**.

---

### 📘 Simple Example:

Let’s say:

* You have a virtual network with 3 subnets.
* You want only HTTP and HTTPS traffic in one subnet and block everything else.
* You create an NSG with rules to allow only HTTP (port 80) and HTTPS (port 443).
* Then you **associate** that NSG to the subnet.

✅ Now, all VMs in that subnet will follow the rules of that NSG.
