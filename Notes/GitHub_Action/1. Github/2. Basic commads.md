Great! Let's go over the **basic Git and GitHub commands** in simple language, with easy explanations and examples. These are the most commonly used commands for beginners.

## 🔧 Basic Git Commands (with Examples)

> 📌 Note: You run these commands in the **terminal** or **command line**.

---

### 1. `git init`

**What it does:**
Starts a new Git project in your folder.

**Example:**
You have a folder called `my-website`. You want Git to track it.

```bash
cd my-website
git init
```

✅ Now Git will track changes in this folder.

---

### 2. `git status`

**What it does:**
Shows the status of your files – like what has changed or needs to be saved (committed).

**Example:**

```bash
git status
```

It will show:

* New files
* Changed files
* Files not tracked yet

---

### 3. `git add <filename>` or `git add .`

**What it does:**
Tells Git which files to prepare for saving (commit).

**Examples:**

```bash
git add index.html        # Adds just one file
git add .                 # Adds all files in the folder
```

---

### 4. `git commit -m "message"`

**What it does:**
Saves your changes with a message that explains what you did.

**Example:**

```bash
git commit -m "Added homepage content"
```

📝 This message helps others (and future you!) know what was changed.

---

### 5. `git log`

**What it does:**
Shows a history of commits (saves) with messages and who made them.

**Example:**

```bash
git log
```

---

### 6. `git clone <URL>`

**What it does:**
Makes a copy of someone else’s project from GitHub to your computer.

**Example:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/user/project.git
```

---

### 7. `git push`

**What it does:**
Sends your changes from your computer **to GitHub**.

**Example:**

```bash
git push origin main
```

🧠 `origin` = GitHub
🧠 `main` = main branch

---

### 8. `git pull`

**What it does:**
Gets the latest changes **from GitHub** to your computer.

**Example:**

```bash
git pull origin main
```

---

### 9. `git branch`

**What it does:**
Shows the branches (versions) of your project.

**Example:**

```bash
git branch
```

To create a new branch:

```bash
git branch new-feature
```

---

### 10. `git checkout <branch-name>`

**What it does:**
Switches to a different branch.

**Example:**

```bash
git checkout new-feature
```

---

### 11. `git merge <branch-name>`

**What it does:**
Combines changes from one branch into another.

**Example:**

```bash
git checkout main
git merge new-feature
```

---

### 🔄 Simple Workflow Example:

1. Create project:

```bash
git init
```

2. Save your first change:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "First version of website"
```

3. Connect to GitHub and push:

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourname/project.git
git push -u origin main
```

## Practice with an example project?


Great! Let's walk through a **simple Git + GitHub example project**, step by step.

---

## 🛠️ Example Project: "My First Website"

We’ll create a small HTML file, use Git to track it, and push it to GitHub.

---

### ✅ What You Need:

1. A GitHub account (free)
2. Git installed on your computer
3. A terminal or command prompt

---

## 🔧 Step-by-Step Guide

---

### **Step 1: Create a folder**

Create a folder on your computer:

```bash
mkdir my-first-website
cd my-first-website
```

---

### **Step 2: Create an HTML file**

Create a simple webpage:

```bash
echo "<!DOCTYPE html><html><head><title>My Website</title></head><body><h1>Hello, GitHub!</h1></body></html>" > index.html
```

---

### **Step 3: Initialize Git**

```bash
git init
```

🧠 This tells Git to start tracking changes in this folder.

---

### **Step 4: Check file status**

```bash
git status
```

You’ll see `index.html` is untracked.

---

### **Step 5: Add the file**

```bash
git add index.html
```

---

### **Step 6: Commit the file**

```bash
git commit -m "Added index.html file"
```

🎉 You’ve now saved a version of your project!

---

### **Step 7: Create a GitHub repository**

1. Go to [github.com](https://github.com)
2. Click **"New repository"**
3. Name it `my-first-website`
4. Click **"Create repository"**

📌 Do **not** check "Initialize with a README".

---

### **Step 8: Connect your local project to GitHub**

GitHub shows you these commands – copy and paste them:

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/my-first-website.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

🔁 This connects your local Git to the GitHub repo and uploads (pushes) your project.

---

### ✅ DONE! Your project is now live on GitHub.

Go to:
📄 `https://github.com/yourusername/my-first-website`

---

## 🎁 Bonus Tip: Make it a live website!

You can turn your project into a live website using **GitHub Pages**:

1. Go to your repo on GitHub
2. Click **Settings > Pages**
3. Under "Source", choose `main` branch
4. Click **Save**

Your site will be live at:
🌍 `https://yourusername.github.io/my-first-website`
