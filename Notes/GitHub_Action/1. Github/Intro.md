### 💡 What is GitHub?

**GitHub** is a **website** and **tool** that helps people **store, share, and work together on code** (and other files).

It uses a system called **Git**, which helps track changes in files over time.

---

### 🚀 Imagine This:

You're writing a book with your friends.

* **Git** is like a **version control system** – it saves **every change** you make to the book, so you can go back if needed.
* **GitHub** is like **Google Drive for Git** – it's a place **online** where everyone can **upload**, **download**, and **work together** on the book.

---

### ✅ What Can You Do with GitHub?

* **Save code online** (so it's not lost if your computer crashes)
* **Work with a team** on the same project at the same time
* **Track changes** to your project
* **Undo mistakes** by going back to old versions
* **Show your work** to others (great for getting jobs or help)

### 🧑‍💻 Simple Example:

Let's say you're building a website with a friend.

1. You write the HTML and CSS.
2. You **upload it to GitHub**.
3. Your friend sees it and adds JavaScript.
4. GitHub saves both versions and shows what each person did.

You can even comment on changes, fix bugs, and more — all in one place!
